# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the Postman Runner File Processor running locally.

1. **Check your Node version**

   Make sure Node.js 18 or newer is installed:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Vite will start the app and reload whenever you make changes.

4. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This executes the Vitest test suite to verify that utilities work as expected.
