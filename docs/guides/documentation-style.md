# Documentation Style Guide

This project uses the following conventions for all documentation:

- **Language**: Write documentation in English.
- **File names**: Use *kebab-case* (lowercase with hyphens) for all markdown file names.
- **Sentence length**: Prefer short sentences that are easy to read.

Keeping every file consistent makes the docs simple to navigate and maintain. When updating or adding documentation, follow these rules and keep the tone concise.
