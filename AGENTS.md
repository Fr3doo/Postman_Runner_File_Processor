All code and documentation changes must pass linting and tests by running:

```
npm run lint
npm test
```

This project is built with React and TypeScript. UI components should use Tailwind CSS for styling and icons from `lucide-react`. Avoid adding other UI or icon libraries unless specifically requested.

When implementing interfaces, produce polished, production-ready designs as described in `.bolt/prompt`.

Unit tests live in `src/utils/__tests__`. Update or add tests there whenever modifying utility code.
